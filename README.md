# Advent of Code 2017 - Day 18 in Haskell

Solution to problem from day 18 of [Advent of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/18).
This is basically a simualtion of two imperative programs interacting via queue.
What better problem to test the limits of pure FP :)

Additional premises:

- fairly typesafe
- proper parser using [megaparsec](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec)
- accessors via [lenses](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens)
